# Family Organiser 

This web application is designed to keep users in touch with their family and allow them to book events, share shopping lists, work together getting chores done, as well as write status and message one another. This idea came to me as in my house remembering to put the bins out and always running out of milk was getting a bit of a problem. I wanted to find a solution but one that I wasn't just in control of, as 'Teamwork makes the dream work', Adding API's and google authentication to speed up the user's interaction with the site was important as we're all short on time.

Please view my project by the link below:

## UX

The overall app theme is green and white with hand drawn icons, I have tried to animate most of the intractions with the application but not to affect loading times. I feel this helps navigate the user to the desiered location and elicit a positive emotional response, making sure the user finds it easy to find their desired impormation and enjoy the process was quite important.

### User

On the profile page I have added a easiy visable '+' Add button so that if the user would like to add data to their profile this can easiy be achiveve. After this button has been pressed the page will open up revealing
a list of actions for the user to choose from, when one of these options has been selected they will ethier be navigated to their desired location or the page will dropdown further displaying a form for the user to fill out.

### Shopping

The first time the user loads this page or if they have no categories the page will be redirected to make sure the user has at least created one category. This is important because when saving an item, a category will have to be selected, this is to help break up their shopping list into different sections, helpful if their shopping and all their items for the 'frozen' foods are together. After an item has been created, it will be saved to a quick add section and the category already saved to that item for convenience.
I have used Ajax to update the page when the user is adding via the quick add option but also when incrementing and decrementing items on their shopping list, reloading the page just didn't give the UX I was going for.

The navigation for this application has been added to the top of the page with three links 'List','Partners','Insight' for the user to easily navigate themself to the location they desire. Also, a shopping partner has been added to help users interact and take the load of big shopping duties.

Under the shopping app, I have added an insights section with a different section that I discuss under the features section. This has been added to make sure the user can see some visual representation for their data. Making sure the user can make the right decision on what foods to be consuming and help keep costs down where needed.

### Status

User's can create and interacte with each others status, liking and commenting to make sure that staying intouch with each other is very important with this appliation.

### Messages

Also a messages app has been created so that users can communicate with one another, I would like to add a email API to this to make sure the user gets notified or somehow get the appliation to notify the user's device.

### Event

Finally this app has been created so that events for holidays, birthdays, days out, any event the user desired can be created with ease. After a event has been created the creator of the event can then invite users from ther family/friends list. I have added some confetti to the invitation to again try and give the user a positive responce when opening their event notification.

### Premium 

Some features to this app are for premium users only, this is the that the cost of hosting the application can pay for itself. The payment is a one off payment only can be easily achieved by the be navigated to the premium app and giving their bank details.

### Notifiations

I have added notifications on the profile page for liked posts, commented posts, accepted friend requests and partner requests. Also, events can be add to the users Google Calendar to make sure they don't miss any events!

## Testing 

I have tried to automate most of the important tests. Also, I have created a functions.py file to make sure the code is easier to read and to make sure that functions that work, can be resued to reduce the amount of bugs.

The views on each app either return the desired page or redirect the user when needed, this has been tested on the test_view.py and I've used coverage to make sure adequate testing has been done.

I have tested some of the larger functions under the test_functions.py.

[Manual Testing](https://github.com/Fordalex/family_organiser/blob/master/readme/testing.md)

## Deployment

I've hosted this project on heroku and also used Travis to make sure the build will pass. Also with this project the static files such as the css, js and images have been hosted using Amazon AWS. The project was hosted by doing the following:

#### Heroku

1. Creating a Procfile with information for heroku on what type of project this is.
2. Creating a requirements.txt file for the python dependencies to be installed to run the application by typing the following command into the terminal 'pip freeze --local > requirements.txt'. 
3. Then creating a new project on heroku.
4. Finally adding the environment variables and deploying the branch.

#### Amazon AWS

1. After loggin into my Amazon account, I search for s3 and create a new bucket and set the access to public.
2. Change the properties to static website hosting.
3. Then under the premissions tab I've added the CORS configuration.
4. Move to the bucket policy I generated a policy type of S3 and the action of 'GetObject'
5. Last configuration setting is under the 'access control list', and I've set the list objects permission to everyone.
6. After thats done I've moved over to IAM and created a new group.
7. Then I created a new policy and imported a manage policy called 'AmazonS3FullAccess'.
8. Next I've added the bucket ARN to the key 'Resource'.
9. Now I'll add the new policy to the group I created eariler.
10. Then creating a user to be added to the group and giving them programmatic access.
11. I then downloaded the csv file after the user was created.

#### Connecting Django to the S3 bucket

Back to the project, two new packages need to be installed for this to work.

1. boto3
2. django-storages

Then I've added the access key and the secret access key to the settings.py file and saving these values as environment variables. These variable were also saved in heroku under 'Confg Vars' for security reasons.
